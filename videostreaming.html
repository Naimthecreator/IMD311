                    <p><br>Yuuji Itadori, a high school student, spends his days either<br>participating in unfounded paranormal activities with the Occult Club or visiting his ill grandpa<br>in the hospital. However, when he unintentionally comes into contact<br>with a cursed artefact, his peaceful existence takes a bizarre turn. After ingesting the<br>alleged object, revealed to be a finger belonging to the<br>demon Sukuna Ryoumen, the King of Curses, Yuuji finds himself unexpectedly forced<br>into the domain of Curses—dreadful entities produced by human hate and negativity.</p>

Cid Kagenou and Shadow Garden examine<br>the Lawless City, a cesspool where three mighty kings rule<br>the streets and the red moon hangs low in<br>the sky. The ultimate pull for Cid, however, is one<br>who can draw blood-the Blood Queen, a vampire who has<br>slept for aeons in her coffin. Cid may face<br>a day of reckoning as her awakening approaches.</p>

                    <p><br>A new Holy Grail War is about to begin in<br>the American metropolis of Snowfield. Such vicious battles pit magic<br>professionals known as magi against one other, who rise to<br>the rank of Master by calling Servants—heroic spirits from the<br>past. Any of the winner's requests are assumed to be<br>granted. However, it seems that the organisation responsible for the<br>current predicament has only managed to build a sloppy replica<br>of the Third Holy Grail War. As the strange<br>ceremony draws the attention of the Mage's Association in London,<br>Flatt Escardos, the young apprentice of Lord El-Melloi II—a past<br>participant in the Fourth Holy Grail War—travels to Snowfield and<br>joins the ranks of the Masters, much to his teacher's chagrin.</p>
