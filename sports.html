                <h2><b>Badminton</b></h2>
                <p>Badminton is a sport that is played on a court or on a lawn using<br>rackets, a net, and a shuttlecock (also known as a birdie). Players serve the shuttlecock<br>using their rackets, sending it over the net to the opposite player. The aim is to<br>utilise your rackets to prevent the shuttlecock from falling on the ground on your side<br>(which would allow your opponent to score a point) and to finesse your racket such<br>that the shuttlecock falls in-bounds on your opponent's side (which would give you a point).<br>The lightweight shuttlecock makes badminton a pleasant, fast-paced game that may be played in<br>backyards, recreational areas, and even professional competitions.</p>
